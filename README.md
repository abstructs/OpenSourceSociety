### Open Source Society

## What is this?
This is a repository containing all my programming course work for my self-taught education in computer science.

As I'm making my code more accessible, I'll be updating this document with descriptions from each class,
what we learned and what projects we worked on.

### Where can I find these courses?
I get asked this often! The answer is [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)!

### What have you learned in summary?
## Comp Sci:
Programming language theory, software engineering, data design and machine learning.

## Math:
Linear algebra, calculus 1 & 2 (differential and integral), and am currently taking discrete from MIT Open Courseware.

### What's next?
I've nearly done all the programming stuff in the standard computer science cirriculumn, however algorithms, proofs,
and theory will be my focus in terms of academic learning for 2018. 

With these courses it's harder to show what I'm learning so I'll also be working with trying to implement real software
with user interfaces to actually show what I'm learning.

### End 
I'll be adding more descriptive details about the contents of this repo. 

You can easily go through the folders and get a feel for it but my goal is to have this stuff be accessible to give others
a better feel for how I've learned programming and computer science.
