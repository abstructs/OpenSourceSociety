### Open Source Society

## What is this?
This is a repository containing all my programming course work for my self-taught education in computer science.

As I'm making my code more accessible, I'll be updating this document with descriptions from each class,
what we learned and what projects we worked on.

### Where can I find these courses?
I get asked this often! The answer is [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)!

### What have you learned in summary?
## Comp Sci:
Programming language theory, data design, algorithms, data structures, machine learning, parallel programming and distributed systems.

## Math:
Linear algebra, calculus 1 & 2.
