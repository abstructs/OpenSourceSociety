0.  A lung disease caused by ash in the lungs.
1.  getrusage records the amount of resources being used by a calling thread
2.  There are 16 values in the rusage structure
3.  getrusage wants to check for the resource of the thread, passing in a 
    non-reference would check the resource cost of the value.
4. Main reads words from a file by reading characters one at a time storing 
   the read character into an array of characters until it reads a non-alphabetical 
   value, an asterisk, or the file reader reaches the end of the file. If the 
   index counting the length of the read string exceeds that of the longest 
   possible word in the dictionary, it is counted as a misspelled word and a 
   while loop will read the remaining characters in the word exhausting the remaining
   characters so we can begin reading a new word. At that point it adds a \0 to 
   indicate the end of the word, sets the index recording the length of the word to 
   0 to prepare for the next word and checks to see if the word is misspelled by passing
   a pointer to the first location in memory of the array into the misspelled method. 
   If it is misspelled, the misspelled word is added to an array of misspelled words. 
5. If you were to use fscanf with %s as a format the file reader may end up reading
    very long words unneccesarily, then inorder to check we would have to read through 
    every index of that word's memory. Whereas if we read one character at a time and we find we 
    exceeded the length limit for a correctly spelled word we can confidently declare
    the word as misspelled and move on to the next one without expending excess resources.
6.  Check and load takes constants as arguments because these functions should not be mutating
    the arguments recieved in anyway as their only purpose in life is to read values.
